## Hey, this is us 👋

Yes, we are building the future of the web at **Yaka Labs**. We’ve been on a mission to rescue the internet from bloated legacy libraries since we pushed our very first commit. Since then, we've focused on making the web faster, interactive, and fun for the next generation of developers. 🤯 We are proud to prove that a 14-year-old developer can lead a movement that makes even the industry "Grandpas" take notice. 🦁 We are part of a global shift toward performance-first software.

### 🍿 An interconnected community

The open-source spirit is the 💗 heart of Yaka Labs and fundamental to how we build YakaJS today. See for yourself:

* **YakaJS** has helped developers shed over **30KB** of legacy bloat in exchange for a **<5KB** powerhouse 🚀
* Our community is proving that you don't need decades of experience to create tools that impact the ecosystem 🎸
* **Every minute** a developer realizes that modern Vanilla JS APIs are better than 15-year-old wrappers 🏄

Now that we are talking about the important things, ☝️ are you still using legacy jQuery in 2026? Yes? It's okay, we can help you get started with the **Underscore ( _ ) Magic**! Open source is built by people just like you. Learn more about [how to contribute to Yaka](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/Yaka-UI-Labs/YakaJS).
