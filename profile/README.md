## Hey, this is us 👋

Yes, we are building the future of the web at **Yaka Labs**. We've been on a mission to rescue the internet from bloated legacy libraries since we pushed our very first commit — and we haven't stopped since. We've focused on making the web faster, interactive, and fun for the next generation of developers. 🤯 We are proud to prove that a small team can lead a movement that makes even the industry "Grandpas" take notice. 🦁 We are part of a global shift toward performance-first software.

### 🍿 An interconnected community
The open-source spirit is the 💗 heart of Yaka Labs and fundamental to how we build YakaJS today. See for yourself:
* **YakaJS** has helped developers shed over **400KB** of legacy plugin bloat in exchange for a **151KB** all-in-one powerhouse 🚀
* Our community is proving that you don't need decades of experience to create tools that impact the ecosystem 🎸
* **Every minute** a developer realizes that modern Vanilla JS APIs are better than 15-year-old wrappers 🏄

Now that we are talking about the important things, ☝️ are you still using legacy jQuery in 2026? Yes? It's okay, we can help you get started with the **Underscore ( _ ) Magic**! Open source is built by people just like you. Learn more about [how to contribute to Yaka](https://github.com/Yaka-UI-Labs/YakaJS).
 

### 🦦 Contributing to the ecosystem
